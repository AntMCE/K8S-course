# AI Tools for Kubernetes


## [K8SGPT](https://k8sgpt.ai/)

As for now, JAN 2024, the project seems to be at a very early stage. No real benefit were found during testing. While the tools is pretty good at detecting issues, it sometimes fails to give relavant debuging tip in order to fixe issues. As of today, having a deep understanding of K8S seems to be the best option to efficently solve issues.

## [PredictKube](https://keda.sh/docs/2.12/scalers/predictkube/)
An AI-based predictive autoscaler for KEDA

This seems interesting to try out since KEDA has [graduated from CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2023/08/22/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-graduation-of-kubernetes-autoscaler-keda/)
